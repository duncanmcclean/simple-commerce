:::note
[Cargo](https://builtwithcargo.dev), the successor to Simple Commerce, is now in alpha and will be released fully in the next couple of months. If you're starting a new project, you should probably use Cargo instead. To learn more, check out the [Cargo documentation](https://builtwithcargo.dev).
:::

To install Simple Commerce, there's two routes you can take. You can either [install into an existing site](#content-installing-into-an-existing-site) or create a fresh Statamic project using the Simple Commerce [starter kit](#content-installing-with-the-starter-kit).

## Requirements

To run Simple Commerce, your server (whether local or production) will need to meet the following requirements:

-   PHP 8.3
-   Laravel 10
-   [PHP `intl` extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php)
-   [Statamic CLI](https://github.com/statamic/cli)
-   Some kind of web server (like [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet))

And if you're installing into an existing site, your site must be on Statamic 5 (or higher) and Laravel 10 (or higher).

## Installing with the Starter Kit

When you're starting afresh, I'd recommend using the Simple Commerce Starter Kit. Simple Commerce comes pre-installed, along with cart/checkout templates and some other tweaks.

:::note Note!
If you want to use something like Peak, you'll want to install that first, then follow the steps on [installing into an existing site](#content-installing-into-an-existing-site).
:::

**1.** Create a site using the Statamic CLI (obviously replace `your-new-site-name` with you actual new site name ðŸ˜…)

```shell
statamic new your-new-site-name duncanmcclean/sc-starter-kit
```

**2.** Now, if you load up the site in your browser, you should see a page like this:

![Starter Kit Starting Point](/img/simple-commerce/starter-kit-starting-point.png)

### What's next?

Now that you're up and running with the Starter Kit, you're probably wanting to get going with development. Here's a list of resources that you might find helpful:

-   Documentation (you're already here)
-   [Knowledge Base](/kb-articles) - for any 'How tos' or explainer articles
-   [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/duncanmcclean/simple-commerce/issues/new/choose) - for reporting any bugs or for requesting features

## Installing into an existing site

**1.** Install Simple Commerce with Composer

```shell
composer require duncanmcclean/simple-commerce
```

**2.** Next, run the `sc:install` command to publish Simple Commerce's config file, collections & blueprints.

```shell
php please sc:install
```

**3.** And, that's you! ðŸš€

If you want to confirm you've installed everything correctly, run `php please support:details` and you should see Simple Commerce in the list.
