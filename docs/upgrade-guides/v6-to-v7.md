## Overview

:::warning Warning
Please don't upgrade multiple versions at once (eg. from v5 to v7). Please upgrade one step at a time.
:::

To get started with the upgrade process, follow the below steps:

**1.** In your `composer.json` file, change the `duncanmcclean/simple-commerce` version constraint to `^7.0`:

```json
"duncanmcclean/simple-commerce": "^7.0"
```

**2.** Then run:

```
composer update duncanmcclean/simple-commerce --with-dependencies
```

**3.** Next, please ensure you have cleared the route and view caches:

```
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

**4.** You're now running Simple Commerce v7. Please review this upgrade guide for information on changes which may affect your project.

**Please test your project locally before deploying to production!**
