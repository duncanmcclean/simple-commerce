## v8.0.0-alpha.1 (2025-08-21)

Simple Commerce has been replaced by [Cargo](https://builtwithcargo.dev), the natural evolution of Simple Commerce. It takes everything you love about Simple Commerce and makes it better in every possible way. Some of the big changes include...

* **A complete re-working of carts & orders** to ultimately make things faster and more reliable.
* **A redesigned Control Panel UI**, ensuring your admins can get what they need at a glance.
* **A massive overhaul to discounting**, allowing for automatic site-wide discounts, as well as traditional coupon-style discounts.
* **Pre-built Checkout Page**, allowing you to level up your customer's purchasing experience.

Simple Commerce v8 is the last major version of Simple Commerce, giving you time to migrate to Cargo. You should read the [upgrade guide](https://simple-commerce.duncanmcclean.com/upgrade-guides/v7-to-v8) before upgrading, in case you need to make any manual changes.
