## Upcoming release

I’ve been working hard behind the scenes on a new version of Simple Commerce. It’s a complete rethinking of how things work, but with the same goal in mind: making it easy to build flexible e-commerce sites in Statamic.

A public alpha will be available shortly after the Statamic 6 alpha, with a full launch happening **alongside Statamic 6**. The new version will be a paid upgrade, but if you purchase Simple Commerce now, you’ll get the new version for free.

## Features

### Everything's just an entry

Stay with what you love - Statamic entries. With Simple Commerce, all of your products, orders, customers & coupons are Statamic entries. Giving you the flexibility you need to build bespoke e-commerce sites for your clients.

And, when your site grows, it's easy to [move your orders & customers](https://simple-commerce.duncanmcclean.com/database-orders) into a traditional database.

### Payment Gateways

Out-of-the-box, Simple Commerce ships with support for three of the big payment gateways: Stripe, PayPal and Mollie. Use whichever one you need, or if you need something else: it's easy to build one.

### Flexible Shipping

Provide your customers with different shipping options depending on their address.

### Discounting

Simple Commerce has support for discount coupons. You can limit coupons to certain products or to be used a max number of times. All your customer has to do is redeem the discount during checkout.

### Product Variants

Sometimes you need to sell different versions of the same product. Like a t-shirt, you might want to sell it in Small, Medium & Large - each with different prices and stock levels. That's where Product Variants come in. Create a single product and configure the variants inside it.

### Multi-site friendly

If you need to sell across different countries, you can take advantage of Statamic's multi-site feature in Simple Commerce to have a site per currency. Each site may also have its own set of shipping methods.

### Digital Products

If you're selling digital products, like software or e-books, Simple Commerce allows you to define the files that should be downloadable by customers after checkout. It also provides a full history of all downloads, including the user's IP address and timestamp.

### And lots more...

Simple Commerce might be simple, but it's not basic - there's dozens of handy features to help you build small-medium e-commerce stores.
