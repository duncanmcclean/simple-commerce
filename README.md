Simple Commerce has been replaced by [Cargo](https://builtwithcargo.dev), the natural evolution of Simple Commerce. It takes everything you love about Simple Commerce and makes it better in every possible way. Some of the big changes include:

* **A complete re-working of carts & orders** to ultimately make things faster and more reliable.
* **A redesigned Control Panel UI**, ensuring your admins can get what they need at a glance.
* **A massive overhaul to discounting**, allowing for automatic site-wide discounts, as well as traditional coupon-style discounts.
* **Pre-built Checkout Page**, allowing you to level up your customer's purchasing experience.

While Simple Commerce v8 is compatible with Statamic 5 and 6, you should investigate migrating to Cargo when possible. You can find more information on the migration process over on the [Cargo documentation](https://builtwithcargo.dev/docs/migrating-from-simple-commerce).
