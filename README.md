Simple Commerce has been replaced by [Cargo](https://builtwithcargo.dev), the natural evolution of Simple Commerce.

Cargo takes everything you love about Simple Commerce and makes it better in every possible way, while simplifying the core model to improve consistency and reliability.

Some of the bigger changes include:

* **A complete re-working of carts & orders** to ultimately make things faster and more reliable.
* **A redesigned Control Panel UI**, ensuring your admins can get what they need at a glance.
* **A massive overhaul to discounting**, allowing for automatic site-wide discounts, as well as traditional coupon-style discounts.
* **Pre-built checkout page**, allowing you to level up your customer's purchasing experience.

Simple Commerce v8 supports Statamic 6, but Cargo is the recommended option for new projects.

You can find more details on the migration process in the [Cargo migration guide](https://builtwithcargo.dev/docs/migrating-from-simple-commerce).
